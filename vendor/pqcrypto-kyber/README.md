# kyber

This crate contains bindings to the C implementations of the following schemes,
from [PQClean][pqc].

This project packages Post-Quantum cryptographic algorithms that participate in
the [NIST PQC standardization effort][nistpqc]. It is currently a collection of
wrappers around C implementations from the [PQClean][pqclean] project.

# Included implementations from PQClean

Below is a list of the included schemes and the corresponding implementations
sourced from [PQClean][pqclean]. The "default" implementation is used in the
Rust-friendly interface, alternative implementations are exposed as ``ffi``
methods only.

 * ``kyber512``
    * ``clean`` (default)
 * ``kyber768``
    * ``clean`` (default)
 * ``kyber1024``
